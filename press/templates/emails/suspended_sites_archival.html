	    <p>Greetings from Frappe!</p>
	    Hope this email finds you well. Your account is currently {{ days_overdue }} overdue, and your suspended sites are scheduled for archival on {{ archival_date }}. To prevent this, please settle the outstanding amount within the next {{ days_before_archival }}.
	    <br><br>
		We do not keep backups of your sites on <strong>{{ '$10' if currency == 'USD' else 'â‚¹820' }}</strong> plan, and once the sites are archived the data is deleted and they cannot be restored.
	    <br><br>
	    In order to activate your account and ignore data loss on archival you can add prepaid credits to your account or settle the payment via card. Login to <a href="/dashboard/billing" style="text-decoration: underline;">Frappe Cloud Dashboard</a> for more details.
	    For more payment options, you can refer to <a href="/payment-options" style="text-decoration: underline;">this link</a>.
	    <br><br>
	    Thank you for your prompt attention.
        </p>
